graphics for EarthFix battle ready project

This folder contains all of the code and assets for the graphics in the "Battle Ready" project. Each graphic has its own html page.

Maps are static images created through QGIS and Adobe Illustrator, saved as either SVG or PNG. The others are generated by highcharts.

The charts are styled through a global settings function found in `js/chart-settings.js`. There is also a central stylesheet found in `css/styles.css`. All of the images are found in the `assets` folder.

The graphics are designed to be readily converted from a light background or dark background, depending on the overall design of the project. Switching between these can be acheived through commenting and uncommenting a few lines of code in the CSS, HTML pages and global settings function. These locations are labeled in the files.
